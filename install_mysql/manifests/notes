this is not a puppet master layout, this is just using puppet modules locally as I would do on a master for the agent to load.

you need to put this whole folder on the module path.  you can get the path by running this command
puppet config print modulepath

Tommorrow i will try to get it working as a Master/Agent, unless you do.  Let me know.
